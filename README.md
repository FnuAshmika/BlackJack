# BlackJack
This project is a Python implementation of the popular card game Blackjack. The game logic is based on the classic rules of the 
game, but with some simplifications to make it easier to program. This project is meant to demonstrate object-oriented programming 
concepts, such as classes and inheritance.
The user will be dealt two cards, and the dealer will be dealt two cards, with one of the dealer's cards hidden from the user. 
The user then has the option to 'Hit' (receive one additional card) or 'Stand' (cease taking cards). If the user's cards total 
more than 21, they 'Bust'. If the user's cards total 21 on the first deal, then the user wins with a 'Blackjack'. The user can 
'Hit' as many times as they like until they either 'Bust' or 'Stand'.

Once the user has chosen to 'Stand', the dealer will reveal their hidden card and compare their total to the user's total. Whoever 
has the higher total wins the round. If both totals are equal, then the round is a 'Push' and nobody wins.

The game continue until the user chooses to quit .
This project is a great way to practice object-oriented programming concepts while having fun!
